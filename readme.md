# Simon Game

An interactive Simon Game - a classic memory and pattern recognition challenge - built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). 

In this game, players are presented with a sequence of colors, each associated with a unique sound. The player must remember and repeat the sequence. With each successful attempt, the sequence becomes longer, providing an increasingly challenging test of memory!

## Features
- **Dynamic Level Advancement**: Each successful level adds a new color to the sequence, progressively increasing difficulty.
- **Responsive Button Animations**: Buttons light up with color and play unique sounds, enhancing the visual and auditory experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Each button has a distinct sound, adding an auditory element to the gameplay.
- **User Input Validation**: The game checks each player input and provides immediate feedback if they make a mistake.
- **Game Over State**: The screen displays a “Game Over” message, and the sequence restarts if an error is made.
- **Smooth Transition Effects**: Buttons have smooth animations and effects that enhance the overall game experience.

## How to Play
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch and listen to the color sequence displayed by the game.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The game adds a new color to the sequence after each successful round.
5. Continue as long as you can match the sequence correctly. If you make a mistake, the game will end and show a “Game Over” message.
